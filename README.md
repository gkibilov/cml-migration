### 🔄 Constraint Expression Set Migration Tool

This tool exports and imports **Constraint ExpressionSet metadata**, including blob files (CML), from one Salesforce org to another using Salesforce CLI + REST API. It support migration of a new CML as well as update of the existing one, but it assumes target org already has relevant Context Definition and PCM data like Attributes, Product Classifications, Products and Product Related Components.
